configuration:
  language:
    name: Auto-train language
    description: >-
      Automatically download model and train for language.
  streaming:
    name: Streaming decoding
    description: >-
      Decode in streaming mode (faster, but less accurate).
  decode_mode:
    name: Decode mode
    description: >-
      Decoding mode.
      Strict is fast, but inflexible.
      Flexible is slower, but can tolerate noise better.
      Flexible 2-pass is even more accurate, but slowest.
      Requires re-training if changed.
  builtin_intents:
    name: Include builtin intents
    description: >-
      Include builtin intents when training.
      Disable to only use your custom sentences.
      Requires re-training if changed.
  download_entities:
    name: Download Home Assistant entities
    description: >-
      Automatically download Home Assistant entities during training.
      Requires re-training if changed.
  # Audio
  volume_multiplier:
    name: Volume multiplier
    description: >-
      Constant to multiply audio samples by (> 1 is louder, < 1 is quieter).
      Default is 1.0.
 # VAD
  vad:
    name: Remove silence
    description: >-
      Remove audio before speech is detected.
      Default is true.
  vad_threshold:
    name: Silence threshold
    description: >-
      Threshold for voice activity detection (0-1).
      Default is 0.5.
  before_speech_seconds:
    name: Before speech seconds
    description: >-
      Seconds of audio to keep before speech is detected.
      Default is 0.7.
  # Speex
  speex:
    name: Clean audio
    description: >-
      Clean audio with Speex.
      Default is false.
  speex_noise_suppression:
    name: Noise suppression level
    description: >-
      Amount of noise suppression (negative, lower is more suppression)
      Default is -30.
  speex_auto_gain:
    name: Auto gain level
    description: >-
      Amount of auto gain (higher is more gain)
      Default is 4000.
  # Fuzzy
  max_fuzzy_cost:
    name: Max fuzzy matching cost
    description: >-
      The default is 3, allowing 2-3 words to be corrected.
      Higher values allow more corrections, but may reduce accuracy.
  # Transcribers
  max_active:
    name: Max decoding candidates
    description: >-
      Maximum number of candidates during decoding.
      Default is 7000.
  lattice_beam:
    name: Lattice beam width
    description: >-
      Width of lattice beam during decoding.
      Default is 8.
  acoustic_scale:
    name: Acoustic weight scale
    description: >-
      Acoustic weight scale during decoding.
      Smaller to adhere more to the trained sentences.
      Default is 0.5.
  beam:
    name: Beam width
    description: >-
      Width of beam during pruning Viterbi beam search in decoding.
      Default is 24.
  nbest:
    name: Max transcripts to match
    description: >-
      Number of top transcripts to consider in matching.
      More candidates increases tolerance to noise, but is slower.
      Default is 3.
      Automatically set to 1 if using grammar decode mode.
  arpa_rescore_order:
    name: Rescore ARPA order
    description: >-
      N-gram order of rescored language model. Higher is more accurate, but slower.
      Requires decode mode set to flexible_2pass.
      Default is 5.
      Requires re-training if changed.
  # Misc
  debug_logging:
    name: Debug logging
    description: >-
