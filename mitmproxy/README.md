# Home assistant add-on: mitmproxy

Mitmproxy is your swiss-army knife for debugging, testing, privacy measurements, and penetration testing. It can be used to intercept, inspect, modify and replay web traffic such as HTTP/1, HTTP/2, WebSockets, or any other SSL/TLS-protected protocols. You can prettify and decode a variety of message types ranging from HTML to Protobuf, intercept specific messages on-the-fly, modify them before they reach their destination, and replay them to a client or server later on. 

Use mitmproxy's main features in a graphical interface with mitmweb. Do you like Chrome's DevTools? mitmweb gives you a similar experience for any other application or device, plus additional features such as request interception and replay.
