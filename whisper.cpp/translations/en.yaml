  beam_size:
    name: Beam size

      Number of simultaneous candidate sentences to consider. Increasing this
      number will make the model more accurate, but slower.
  audio_context_base:
    name: Audio context base
    description: >-
      A number from 0-1500 that determines how much audio history to consider
      when processing. Increasing this number will make the model more accurate,
      but slower. If the number is too small, you may get repeated text or times
      when the model takes much longer to respond.
