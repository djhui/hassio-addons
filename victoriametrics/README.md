## About

VictoriaMetrics is a fast, cost-effective and scalable monitoring solution and
time series database. It's a great choice if you want long term storage for your
HomeAssistant Data and do custom evaluations longer than your default
HomeAssistant Retention.

You can run this addon in two different ways:

### Server

Run an full
[ultra efficent Time Series Database](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics#prominent-features)
Server even on low speced computers as the Raspberry PI.

### Agent

This add-on makes it easy to scrape (i.e. fetch) metrics locally, cache them in
a local temporary database, and send them to your centralized Victoria Metrics
Time Series Database Server as soon as is is reachable, thus allowing to have
full data even if the database is down or unreachable at times.
